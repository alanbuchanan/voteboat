#### Tools
- **Front end**: I used the [angular-fullstack Yeoman generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack), with Bootstrap. Chart.js came in userful for displaying the poll's results.
- **Back end**: Node.js & Express with MongoDB for storing users and polls.

#### User Stories
- As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
- As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
- As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
- As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
- As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
- As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
- As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
